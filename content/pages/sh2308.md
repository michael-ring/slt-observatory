# Description
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Sh 2-308, also designated as Sharpless 308, RCW 11, or LBN 1052,[1] and commonly known as the Dolphin-Head Nebula, is an H II region located near the center of the constellation Canis Major, composed of ionised hydrogen.[2] It is about 8 degrees south of Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky. The nebula is bubble-like and surrounds a Wolfâ€“Rayet star named EZ Canis Majoris. This star is in the brief, pre-supernova phase of its stellar evolution. The nebula is about 4,530 light-years (1,389 parsecs) away from Earth,[3] but some sources indicate that both the star and the nebula are up to 5,870 ly (1,800 pc) away.[4][5] Yet others indicate the nebula is as close as 1,875 ly (575 pc) from Earth.[6]
