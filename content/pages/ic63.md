# Description
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

IC 63 is sometimes dubbed the Ghost Nebula, or the ghost of Cassiopeia.[11] It was discovered by Max Wolf on the same night as IC 59,[7] and has since been extensively studied.[10] It spans an angular size of 10′ and is visible with a small telescope.[9] From the perspective of the Earth, IC 63 is positioned behind γ Cas, and the closest tip to the star is located at a separation of 7.5 ly (2.3 pc). It is a photodissociation region that is being sculpted by γ Cas. Light from the star is being scattered from the nebula at an angle of 154° toward the Earth.[6]

There is no evidence of triggered star formation in this nebula.[5] The warmer component of this nebula has a mean temperature of 740±47 K, while the cooler component is 207±30 K.[10] The velocity distribution across the nebula varies with the distance from the star, and is consistent with it being driven by the radiation.[12] The atomic hydrogen in the PDR structure has a clumpy organization, while the tip has a ring-like structure. The entire structure seems to be moving apart and it is likely that this nebula will completely disperse within a half million years.[13]
